# IEMS 5780 / IERG 4080<br/>Building and Deploying Scalable Machine Learning Services<br/>(2018-2019 Term 1)

## Course Description

Machine learning refers to making computer to perform various tasks by learning from data. It is also now one of the essential components in many online services, such as in generating personalized recommendations on e-commerce platforms, performing face detection and recognition, predicting the arrival time of delivery, etc. Given the widespread usage of machine learning, it is important that complex machine learning models can be deployed in an efficient way to support real time services at scale and to allow seamless update of the models.

This course will introduce basic concepts in computer networking and network programming, and then go ton to introduce how scalable online services can be created and maintained, with a focus on services that nvolve machine learning. Topics will include asynchronous programming, distributed message queues and brokers, load balancers, micro-services, distributed caches and databases, and challenges and solutions in deploying various machine learning models.
